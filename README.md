# Eventall
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
In the post Covid world, where human interactions are slowly returning to what they used to be, Eventall presents an easy solution for finding interactive events nearby. 

<br>

<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>With wholesome interactions and fun events in mind, Eventall serves as a platform to host events. It has following features:
Login/Register: To access a variety of features on the website, it is required to make an account. All the data is stored in a database.<p>

<p>Host Event: After registering, the user can easily host an event on the website by filling a simple form. The website automatically geocodes the location, displaying it for ease of travel.<p>

<p>Reviews: User can also post star rating and a review about a event they attended after logging in into the website.</p>

<h2>How we built it</h2>
The website is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript with Express and Passport.


<h2>What's next for Eventall<h2>
The next aim for Eventall is to make it more scalable and easily accessible. I am also hoping to add a user interaction forum on the website in the next version.
